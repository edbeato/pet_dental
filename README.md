## Summary

[Pet Dental: Part 1 - Data]()

[Pet Dental: Part 2 - Demand Plan]()

This case is designed to follow the workflow of a dmenad planner for a pet company. The study was broken down into two parts. 

*Part 1*

A pet consumables dental brand needs to understand how their products are performing in specific markets and what growth/changes have occurred over the last few periods.

My goal is to develop a detailed, meaningful analysis of the data to provide the pet dental brand insights into their market over time.
I also identified trends in the data that the brand should be paying attention to in comparison to their competitors.

*Part 2*

A pet consumables brand is looking to revamp their planning process. The brand currently offers 75 SKUS and sells into a variety of channels (retail, ecommerce platforms and directly to thier consumer). Also, they are not planning on launching any new products during the year and don't expect any new customers. 

My goal is to develop a monthly demand plan forecast for 2024 at the SKU level.
